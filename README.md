# PHP Generics Design Library
This repository contains a design for a language-integrated PHP generics library. This is not (currently) usable in any version of PHP. The purpose of this repository is to:

  - Determine the feature set needed to provide a viable generics in the core language.
  - Design a migration path for built-in interfaces such as `ArrayAccess`, `IteratorAggregate`, `Iterator`, etc.
  - Design a library similar to the SPL that is generics-oriented to help refine the design of the features.

This work will provide guidance for the [RFC on generics](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/generics).
